[00:43.82] Sometimes I wake up and I'm falling asleep
[00:48.28] I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
[00:53.25] But I wake up
[00:55.82] Yes, I wake up smiling
[01:06.82] 
[01:04.51] Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
[01:09.32] Surprisingly good to be moving around
[01:13.89] So I wake up
[01:16.47] Yes, I wake up smiling
[01:27.47] 
[01:24.35] So what? I feel fine
[01:29.54] I'm okay
[01:32.31] I've seen the lighter side of life
[01:35.55] But I'm alright
[01:37.30] I feel good
[01:39.98] So I'll go
[01:42.66] I'll try and stop moving
[01:54.66] 
[01:56.38] Sometimes I wake up and I'm falling asleep
[02:00.84] But I've got to get going so much that I'm wanting to do
[02:08.58] But I wake up smiling
[02:19.08] 
[02:19.32] And this could be my last chance
[02:24.55] Of saving my innocence
[02:35.55] 
[02:29.56] And this could be my last chance
[02:34.42] No more keeping my feet on the ground
[02:52.92] 
[02:48.25] Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
[02:52.45] Surprisingly good to be moving around
[02:57.03] And I move
[03:00.09] I wake up smiling
[03:08.59] 
[03:07.14] So what? I feel fine
[03:12.79] I feel okay
[03:15.02] I've seen the lighter side of life
[03:17.54] I'm alright, I feel good
[03:22.48] So I'll go
[03:25.15] Well, it's time to stop moving
[03:40.15] 
[03:30.83] And this could be my last chance
[03:35.83] Of saving my innocence
[03:41.08] And this could be my last chance
[03:45.55] So no more keeping my feet on the ground
[04:05.55] 
[03:59.45] I'm not gonna keep on
[04:01.97] I'm not gonna keep on
[04:09.43] I'm not gonna keep on
[04:11.71] I'm not gonna keep on, oooh
