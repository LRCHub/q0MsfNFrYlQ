I don't want to walk around alone no more
In sleepytown, no fun no more
It's silent till the breeze strips bark from the trees

I don't want to lie tonight in bed alone
Or light a fire when no-one else is home
Here's a picture of a skeleton I drew when I missed my friends

I send them all my photographs
Cecilia St down to old St Mary's Pass
Some double exposure shots of pelicans in polka dots

I've got horizons
I've got my license
But this truck's all broken down
And nothing can shake this now
Stuck here in sleepytown
